### Minor groove output files

[3DNA](https://x3dna.org/) (Lu and Olson, 2003) is used to calculate the minor groove values of DNA. It generates an output file for every coordinate file and saves the output file with _.out_ extension.

This folder contains _.out_ files that includes the minor groove values of 

- DNA:Sox11, 
- Sox11:syad, 
- Sox11:SHL2 and 
- Sox11:SHL4 simulations. 

You can download the _601-SHL024 (free nucleosome)_ results from **[drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1canqSOeYk0DvIXGPGSaQWv3pSQD0MveV)**, since the file sizes are too big.
