## Interfacea Results

Molecular interaction profiles of complexes were calculated by using the Interfacea Python library (https://github.com/JoaoRodrigues/interfacea).

How to run the Interfacea over the simulation are explained under [Scripts/Interactions/Interfacea](https://github.com/BurcuOzden/Sox-PTF/tree/main/Scripts/Interactions/Interfacea).

The output files are deposited here as raw outputs for DNA:Sox11, Sox11:dyad, Sox11:SHL2 and Sox11:SHL4 simulations.
