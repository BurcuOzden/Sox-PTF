## Important DNA:Sox interactions for specific binding of Sox

The Sox:DNA interactions reported to be critical to Sox:DNA recognition are demonstrated as below. 
The cognate sequence 5’-TTGT-3’ and its complementary Sox binding motif is specifically recognized by the hydrogen bonds formed by Arg51, Asn54, and Tyr118, 
and hydrophobic interactions by Phe56 and Met57.

So, we focused on these specific Sox:DNA interactions among all Sox:DNA interactions by using the scripts given under [Scripts/Interactions/Interaction_Selection/](https://github.com/BurcuOzden/Sox-PTF/tree/main/Scripts/Interactions/Interaction_Selection).

These selected interactions are presented here.
