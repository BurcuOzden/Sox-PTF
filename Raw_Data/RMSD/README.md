## P-RMSD Files

P-RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviations of the DNA Phosphorus atoms) computations are performed with Profit (Martin, A.C.R., http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/).
The output files are presented here.

References folder contains pdb file of the reference structure (X-Ray structure of DNA:Sox11, pdb id:6t78). For P-RMSD computation in Profit, the reference structure and the simulation confermers should have the same chain id and residue numbers. That's why, we rearranged the reference structure's chain id and residue numbers according to DNA:sox11, 601-SHL024 (free nucleosome), Sox11:SHL2, Sox11:dyad and Sox11:SHL4 complexes and deposited under References folder.

### Reference
P-RMSD fitting is performed using the McLachlan algorithm (McLachlan, A.D., 1982 'Rapid Comparison of Protein Structures', Acta Cryst A38, 871-873) as implemented in the program ProFit (Martin, A.C.R., http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/).
