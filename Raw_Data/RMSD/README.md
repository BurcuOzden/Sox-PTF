## P-RMSD Files

P-RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviations of the DNA Phosphorus atoms) computations are performed with Profit (Martin, A.C.R., http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/).
The output files are presented here.

### Reference
P-RMSD fitting is performed using the McLachlan algorithm (McLachlan, A.D., 1982 'Rapid Comparison of Protein Structures', Acta Cryst A38, 871-873) as implemented in the program ProFit (Martin, A.C.R., http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/).
