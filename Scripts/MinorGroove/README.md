## Extract minor groove values from 3DNA output files and plot the minor groove graphs

3DNA (Lu and Olson, 2003) is used to calculate the minor groove values of DNA. It can be downloaded from [3DNA website](https://x3dna.org/about/). It generates an output file for every coordinate file and saves the output file with _.out_ extension.

[This script](https://github.com/BurcuOzden/Sox-PTF/blob/main/Scripts/MinorGroove/MinorGroove-function.ipynb) extracts the minor groove values from these output files and plots the minor groove graph as below.
