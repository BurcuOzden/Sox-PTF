Minor Groove 
3DNA (Lu and Olson, 2003) is used to calculate the minor groove values of DNA. It can be downloaded from [3DNA website]([https://x3dna.org/about/]). 3DNA generates an output file for each coordinate file.
This scripts extracts minor groove values from the output files and plots the minor groove graphs.
